For now, you can still check us out at [junkfm.com](https://junkfm.com).

## Vite run/kill shortcuts (WIP)

### TO RUN:

You can run `npm run dev` OR use the following shortcut in VSCode:

1. Hold `CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + r + t` _(opens the command pallet with the "ðŸš€Dev" workflow selected at the top)_
2. Press `ENTER` _(runs the app)_

### TO KILL:

You can do a `COMMAND + c` in the terminal but, in case of future expansion or adding envs:

1. In VSCode, run `CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + k` _(kills all pertinent processes)_

#### ðŸ’¡ I'll add some automation scripts later. Steal at will!
